# Amazon Customer Reviews
Amazon Customer Reviews (a.k.a. Product Reviews) is one of Amazonâ€™s iconic products. 
In a period of over two decades since the first review in 1995, millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million
reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website.

### Presenting the problem.
The aim of this project is to extract knowledge from Amazon's repository data. The dataset we present contains reviews of products from
various categories. The category we selected is 'Personal Care Appliances'. Since there is no target variable to predict in Amazon's repository, we will select the category after processing and exporting the final dataset.
